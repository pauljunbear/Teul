## What It Does

### Colors
Access historic color palettes from two classic sources:

**Sanzo Wada** — 348 colors and 159 harmonious combinations from the 1934 book *A Dictionary of Color Combinations*. These palettes have stood the test of time—used by textile designers, artists, and graphic designers for nearly a century.

**Werner's Nomenclature of Colours** — 110 colors from Patrick Syme's 1814 guide, originally created for naturalists to describe specimens. Each color includes examples from the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms.

- Browse by hue family (reds, yellows, greens, blues, purples, neutrals)
- See which colors pair well together based on Wada's original combinations
- Apply colors directly to your Figma selection
- Generate full color systems with 12-step scales from any combination
- Export as CSS variables or JSON

### Grids
Apply classic Swiss-style grid systems to your frames.

- Library of Müller-Brockmann-inspired presets (4-column, 6-column, modular, baseline)
- Save and reuse custom grids across projects

## Why It's Useful

Color decisions are hard. Grid setup is tedious. This plugin gives you vetted starting points for both—so you spend less time on fundamentals and more time designing.

The color combinations aren't generated by an algorithm. They're curated pairings from a designer who spent his career studying color relationships. The grids aren't arbitrary—they're proven structures from the Swiss typographic tradition.

## Credits

This plugin was built using data and tools from these generous sources:

### Color Data

**Sanzo Wada** — Color data from *A Dictionary of Color Combinations* (配色辞典, 1934), digitized by [Dain M. Blodorn Kim](https://sanzo-wada.dmbk.io/).

**Werner's Nomenclature of Colours** — Based on the 1814 book by Patrick Syme (extending Abraham Gottlob Werner's original classification), digitized by [Nicholas Rougeux](https://www.c82.net/werner/).

### Color System Generation

**Radix UI Colors** — The color system generator uses [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) as the foundation for creating accessible, harmonious 12-step color scales. Radix's carefully designed scales ensure consistent contrast ratios and work seamlessly across light and dark modes.
