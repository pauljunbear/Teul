## What It Does

### Colors
Access 348 colors and 159 harmonious combinations from Sanzo Wada's 1934 book *A Dictionary of Color Combinations*. These palettes have stood the test of time—used by textile designers, artists, and graphic designers for nearly a century.

- Browse by hue family (reds, yellows, greens, blues, purples, neutrals)
- See which colors pair well together based on Wada's original combinations
- Apply colors directly to your Figma selection
- Generate full color systems with 12-step scales from any combination
- Export as CSS variables or JSON

### Grids
Apply classic Swiss-style grid systems to your frames, or analyze any image to extract its underlying structure.

- Library of Müller-Brockmann-inspired presets (4-column, 6-column, modular, baseline)
- AI-powered grid detection from reference images
- Save and reuse custom grids across projects

## Why It's Useful

Color decisions are hard. Grid setup is tedious. This plugin gives you vetted starting points for both—so you spend less time on fundamentals and more time designing.

The color combinations aren't generated by an algorithm. They're curated pairings from a designer who spent his career studying color relationships. The grids aren't arbitrary—they're proven structures from the Swiss typographic tradition.
