Start development mode with file watching.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs webpack in watch mode. Changes to src/ files will automatically rebuild.

To test changes in Figma:
1. Save your file (triggers rebuild)
2. In Figma: Plugins → Development → Teul → "Run last used"
3. Or press Cmd+Option+P to rerun
